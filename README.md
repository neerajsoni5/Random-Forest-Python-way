Classification using  random Forest in Python

Random Forest is a supervised Machine Learning Algorithm,works for both classification and regression problems.
Random Forest is an ensemble learning  (both classification and regression) technique. It is one of the commonly used predictive modelling and machine learning technique.
In a normal decision tree, one decision tree is built and in a random forest algorithm number of decision trees are built during the process. Since , many decision trees are built and used in a process of Random Forest algorithm, it is called a forest.
For a building a decision tree in RF, samples of a data frame are selected with replacement along with selecting a subset of variables for each of the decision tree. Both sampling of data frame and selection of subset of the variables are done randomly, so first word “random”is arrived.
A vote from each of the decision trees is considered in deciding the final class of a case or an object, this is called ensemble process.
Ensemble Learning is a type of Supervised Learning Technique in which the basic idea is to generate multiple Models on a training dataset and then simply combining(average for regression and vote count for classification
Random Forest works on the same principle as Decision Tress. It combines the output of multiple decision trees and then finally come up with its own output(however, it does not select all the data points and variables in each of the trees,like Desicison tree).
Random Forest is a bagging algorithm rather than a boosting algorithm.
